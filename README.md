# captureScreen
A simple screen recorder written in (pure) Go.

### Technical description
Talks to the Win32 API to take a screenshot every so often (whatever fps was used) and afterwards bundles it up into an AVI file.

### Disclaimer
This code is merely for my own practice and shouldn't be relied on, however, I hope you can use it as an example.
